ToothTimer
==========

Pebble app for timing the brushing of teeth (3 minutes).

It shows different, specific parts of the mouth (upper right outer, lower left inner, etc.) with a countdown timer for how long 
to focus on it (currently 10 seconds each), along with a brief delay at the start to get ready. It vibrates between each step so you don't have to watch the watch while you're brushing. The backlight turns on right before it proceeds to the next step to make it easy for the user to see what is coming up next.
